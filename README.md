# HTML-Comments-Mozilla-addon
This Mozilla Add-on is a tool that can be used during Web application security testing to find if any sensitive information is stored within html comments.

Currently it will only identify HTML comments. Anyone who wants to add more functionality or improve it, you are welcome to do it.

NOTE : I'm a pentester and not a developer.
